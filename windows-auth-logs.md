# Windows Authentication Logs: A Deep Dive into Threat Hunting Gold

Authentication logs are the silent sentinels of your Windows domain. Every day, these logs capture thousands of events that, when properly analyzed, reveal the intricate patterns of both legitimate users and potential threats lurking in your network. Security analysts who master the art of parsing these logs gain an invaluable advantage in threat detection and incident response.

## Understanding the Logging Landscape

The Windows Security Event Log forms the backbone of authentication monitoring in Active Directory environments. While Event IDs 4624 (successful logon) and 4625 (failed logon) often take center stage, the authentication logging landscape encompasses a far broader spectrum of security-relevant events. Each event type provides unique insights into your environment's authentication patterns and potential security incidents.

### Core Authentication Events

The foundation of Windows authentication logging revolves around several critical event IDs:

4624 (Successful Logon): These events contain detailed information about successful authentication attempts. The logon type field proves particularly crucial for analysis:
- Type 2: Interactive (local logon)
- Type 3: Network (accessing network resources)
- Type 4: Batch (scheduled tasks)
- Type 5: Service (service startup)
- Type 7: Unlock (workstation unlock)
- Type 8: NetworkCleartext (most commonly seen with IIS Basic Authentication)
- Type 9: NewCredentials (RunAs using alternate credentials)
- Type 10: RemoteInteractive (RDP or Remote Assistance)
- Type 11: CachedInteractive (logging on to a cached domain profile when DC is unavailable)

4625 (Failed Logon): These events provide essential details about authentication failures, including:
- Sub Status codes that specify the exact reason for failure
- The security ID and account name that failed to log on
- The workstation name and source network address
- The exact process that attempted the logon
- The failure reason, which can range from bad passwords to expired accounts

4648 (Explicit Credential Use): Often overlooked but critically important, these events record instances where a user attempts to authenticate using explicit credentials, such as running a program as a different user. They're particularly valuable for detecting credential theft and abuse.

4634 and 4647 (Logoff Events): Understanding session termination is just as important as tracking logons. These events help establish session duration and identify unusual patterns in session length.

### Advanced Authentication Events

Beyond the core events, several other event types provide crucial context:

4672 (Special Privileges): Generated when an account with administrative privileges logs on, these events help track privileged access across your environment.

4776 (NTLM Authentication): These events document credential validation attempts using NTLM authentication. They're particularly important for detecting pass-the-hash attacks and monitoring legacy authentication methods.

4768 and 4769 (Kerberos Events): These events track Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) requests and service ticket operations, essential for understanding Kerberos authentication flows and detecting attacks like Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket.

4771 (Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failed): These events can indicate potential brute force attempts against Active Directory accounts.

### Event Correlation and Context

Individual events tell only part of the story. The real power lies in understanding the relationships between different event types. For instance:
- A 4624 Type 3 logon followed by multiple 4688 process creation events might indicate lateral movement
- Multiple 4625 events across different accounts from the same source IP often suggests a password spray attack
- A 4624 Type 10 logon followed by 4648 events could indicate an attacker establishing persistence

### Logging Configuration Considerations

Proper logging configuration proves essential for effective monitoring. Consider these key points:
- Enable Advanced Audit Policy Configuration through Group Policy
- Configure appropriate log sizes to prevent log rollover (minimum 1GB for security logs on domain controllers)
- Enable object access auditing for sensitive resources
- Implement log forwarding to ensure centralized collection and analysis
- Consider enabling command line auditing (Event ID 4688) to capture process command line arguments

The Windows authentication logging framework provides unprecedented visibility into your environment's authentication patterns. However, this visibility comes with responsibility â€“ you must properly configure, collect, and analyze these events to derive meaningful security value from them.

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

Security analysts must think beyond individual events. Authentication logs become particularly powerful when analyzed in aggregate. A single failed logon might be a user mistyping their password. Ten failed attempts across different accounts within minutes? That's a potential password spray attack.

Consider this real-world scenario: During incident response, we discovered a compromised service account by correlating unusual Type 10 (RemoteInteractive) logons with subsequent network logons from unfamiliar IP addresses. The authentication logs provided the breadcrumbs that led us straight to the attacker's foothold.

## Practical Implementation

Modern security information and event management (SIEM) platforms make log analysis more accessible, but understanding the raw events remains crucial. Let's explore several practical approaches to extracting and analyzing authentication data.

### Basic Authentication Monitoring

PowerShell serves as a powerful tool for initial investigation. This script provides a foundation for monitoring authentication events:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624,4625
    StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
} | Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,
    @{N='LogonType';E={$_.Properties[8].Value}},
    @{N='Account';E={$_.Properties[5].Value}},
    @{N='SourceIP';E={$_.Properties[18].Value}}
```

### Advanced Event Correlation

For more sophisticated analysis, we can correlate multiple event types. This script identifies potential lateral movement by tracking network logons followed by process creation events:

```powershell
$timeWindow = 300 # 5 minutes in seconds
$networkLogons = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624
} | Where-Object {$_.Properties[8].Value -eq 3} |
    Select-Object TimeCreated,
    @{N='Account';E={$_.Properties[5].Value}},
    @{N='SourceIP';E={$_.Properties[18].Value}}

$suspiciousActivity = foreach ($logon in $networkLogons) {
    $processCreation = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
        LogName='Security'
        ID=4688
        StartTime=$logon.TimeCreated
        EndTime=$logon.TimeCreated.AddSeconds($timeWindow)
    } | Where-Object {$_.Properties[1].Value -eq $logon.Account}
    
    if ($processCreation) {
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            Time = $logon.TimeCreated
            Account = $logon.Account
            SourceIP = $logon.SourceIP
            ProcessName = $processCreation.Properties[5].Value
        }
    }
}
```

### Detecting Password Spraying

Here's a practical implementation for identifying potential password spray attacks:

```powershell
$timeFrame = 10 # minutes
$threshold = 5  # failed attempts

Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4625
    StartTime=(Get-Date).AddMinutes(-$timeFrame)
} | Group-Object {$_.Properties[19].Value} | 
    Where-Object {$_.Count -ge $threshold} |
    Select-Object @{N='SourceIP';E={$_.Name}},
    @{N='FailedAttempts';E={$_.Count}},
    @{N='UniqueAccounts';E={
        ($_.Group | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Properties | 
         Select-Object -Index 5 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Value -Unique).Count
    }}
```

### Service Account Monitoring

Service accounts often require special attention. This script identifies unusual authentication patterns for service accounts:

```powershell
$serviceAccounts = Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -like "*"} |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName

Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624
    StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
} | Where-Object {
    $serviceAccounts -contains $_.Properties[5].Value -and
    $_.Properties[8].Value -in @(2,10) # Interactive or RemoteInteractive
} | Select-Object TimeCreated,
    @{N='Account';E={$_.Properties[5].Value}},
    @{N='LogonType';E={$_.Properties[8].Value}},
    @{N='WorkstationName';E={$_.Properties[11].Value}}
```

### Real-time Monitoring with Event Subscriptions

For continuous monitoring, we can implement real-time event subscriptions:

```powershell
$query = @"
    <QueryList>
        <Query Path='Security'>
            <Select>
                *[System[(EventID=4624)]] and
                *[EventData[Data[@Name='LogonType']='10']]
            </Select>
        </Query>
    </QueryList>
"@

$action = {
    param($event)
    $account = $event.Properties[5].Value
    $sourceIP = $event.Properties[18].Value
    $logonType = $event.Properties[8].Value
    
    # Custom alerting logic here
    if ($sourceIP -notin $trustedIPs) {
        Send-MailMessage -To "soc@company.com" -Subject "Suspicious RDP Logon" `
            -Body "Account: $account`nSource: $sourceIP"
    }
}

Register-WmiEvent -Query $query -SourceIdentifier "RDPMonitor" -Action $action
```

These examples demonstrate the power of Windows authentication logs when combined with automated analysis. The key lies in understanding both the event structure and the context in which these events occur. Advanced analysts often combine these techniques with other data sources: process creation events (4688), explicit credential usage (4648), and NTLM authentication events (8004).

## Advanced Threat Detection and Hunting Strategies

Authentication logs reveal complex attack patterns when analyzed through sophisticated detection frameworks. Modern threat hunting requires moving beyond simple indicator matching to understand the subtle patterns that distinguish genuine threats from routine anomalies. Let's explore advanced detection strategies through real-world scenarios and practical implementations.

### Pattern Analysis and Behavioral Profiling

Authentication patterns often reveal attacker activities before traditional indicators emerge. Consider a sophisticated APT group that compromised a network through stolen service account credentials. The initial access appeared legitimate, but analysis of authentication patterns revealed subtle anomalies:

The compromised service account exhibited slight variations in its authentication sequence. While the legitimate service typically generated Type 3 logons followed by predictable process creation events, the compromised account showed intermittent Type 10 logons and unusual process relationships. This detection required establishing detailed behavioral baselines:

```powershell
# Example of behavioral baseline monitoring
$serviceAccount = "svc_backup"
$baselinePeriod = (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)
$currentPeriod = (Get-Date).AddHours(-1)

# Get historical pattern
$baselinePattern = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624
    StartTime=$baselinePeriod
} | Where-Object {$_.Properties[5].Value -eq $serviceAccount} |
    Group-Object {$_.Properties[8].Value} |
    Select-Object Name, Count

# Compare with current behavior
$currentPattern = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624
    StartTime=$currentPeriod
} | Where-Object {$_.Properties[5].Value -eq $serviceAccount} |
    Group-Object {$_.Properties[8].Value} |
    Select-Object Name, Count

# Calculate deviation from baseline
$deviation = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $baselinePattern -DifferenceObject $currentPattern -Property Name, Count
```

### Temporal Analysis and Event Sequencing

Sophisticated attacks often manifest in subtle temporal patterns. During a recent incident response, we identified a compromised domain admin account by analyzing the temporal relationships between authentication events:

```powershell
# Temporal sequence analysis
$suspiciousSequence = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624,4672,4688
    StartTime=(Get-Date).AddHours(-24)
} | Where-Object {
    # Look for privileged logons followed by unusual process creation
    $_.Id -eq 4672 -and
    ($_.TimeCreated - $lastLogon).TotalSeconds -lt 30 -and
    $nextProcess.ProcessName -notin $whitelist
}
```

### Geographic and Network-based Detection

Modern enterprises generate authentication events across multiple geographic locations. This creates opportunities for sophisticated detection strategies:

1. Impossible Travel Analysis: By correlating authentication source IPs with geographic locations, we can identify authentications that violate physical travel constraints. Implementation requires maintaining IP geolocation data and calculating feasible travel times between authentication points.

2. Network Topology Analysis: Authentication patterns should align with expected network flows. Deviations might indicate lateral movement or network discovery:

```powershell
# Network flow analysis
$knownPaths = Import-Csv "network_paths.csv"
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624
    StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
} | Where-Object {
    $src = $_.Properties[18].Value
    $dst = $_.Properties[11].Value
    $path = "$src->$dst"
    $path -notin $knownPaths.ValidPaths
} | Select-Object TimeCreated,
    @{N='Source';E={$_.Properties[18].Value}},
    @{N='Destination';E={$_.Properties[11].Value}}
```

### Advanced Correlation and Context Enhancement

Modern threat detection requires correlating authentication events with broader system and network context. Consider these advanced detection scenarios:

1. Authentication-Process-Network Chain Analysis: Track the sequence of authentication, subsequent process creation, and network connections to identify attack patterns:

```powershell
# Chain analysis implementation
$chainWindow = 300 # 5 minute window
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4624
} | ForEach-Object {
    $auth = $_
    $processes = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
        LogName='Security'
        ID=4688
        StartTime=$auth.TimeCreated
        EndTime=$auth.TimeCreated.AddSeconds($chainWindow)
    }
    $network = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
        LogName='Security'
        ID=5156
        StartTime=$auth.TimeCreated
        EndTime=$auth.TimeCreated.AddSeconds($chainWindow)
    }
    # Analyze the chain for suspicious patterns
}
```

2. Credential Usage Tracking: Monitor how credentials are used across the environment to identify potential theft and abuse:

```powershell
# Credential usage tracking
$credentialEvents = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName='Security'
    ID=4648,4624
} | Group-Object {$_.Properties[5].Value} |
    ForEach-Object {
        $account = $_.Name
        $usagePattern = $_.Group | Group-Object {$_.Properties[8].Value}
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            Account = $account
            UsageTypes = ($usagePattern | Select-Object Name).Name -join ','
            Count = $_.Count
            Sources = ($_.Group | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Properties |
                Select-Object -Index 18 -Unique).Value
        }
    }
```

### Machine Learning Integration

While rule-based detection remains valuable, machine learning models can identify subtle patterns that traditional rules might miss. Consider implementing:

1. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Use techniques like Isolation Forest or Local Outlier Factor to identify unusual authentication patterns without predefined rules.

2. Sequential Pattern Mining: Implement algorithms to discover frequent authentication sequences and flag deviations.

3. Time Series Analysis: Apply statistical methods to detect anomalies in authentication frequencies and patterns over time.

These advanced detection strategies require substantial infrastructure for data collection and analysis. Success depends on maintaining clean data, establishing accurate baselines, and continuously tuning detection parameters based on environmental changes and emerging threats.

## Operational Considerations

While authentication logs provide immense value, they also present operational challenges. High-volume environments can generate millions of events daily. Effective analysis requires both technical expertise and operational wisdom.

Storage and retention policies must balance security requirements with practical limitations. Consider implementing circular logging with sufficient capacity for your investigation timeframes. Critical authentication events might warrant longer retention than routine successes.

## Looking Forward

The authentication logging landscape continues to evolve. Microsoft's Advanced Audit Policy Configuration offers increasingly granular control over what gets logged. New authentication mechanisms like Windows Hello and certificate-based authentication add complexity to the analysis process.

Security analysts must stay current with these changes while maintaining focus on fundamental analysis techniques. The core principles of authentication log analysis remain constant: understand the normal, investigate the abnormal, and always consider the broader context.

Remember: authentication logs are not just audit trails â€“ they're the nervous system of your security monitoring infrastructure. Master their analysis, and you'll have an invaluable tool in your defensive arsenal.
